# This App is solely based on hjyssg lan-chat but I tried to make the UI a bit better. It was a way for me to train in html and python Flask.

# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built with Flask and Socket.IO, allowing users to communicate in real-time via a web interface.
Most of the python coding is not made by me but by hjyssg. I just modified the GUI to make it look better.
